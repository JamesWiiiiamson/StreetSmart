StreetSmart 

StreetSmart is a web application designed to help people find safer walking routes while walking at night, not just the shortest ones. Instead of optimizing for distance, StreetSmart prioritizes user safety by using data to decide route selection.

This project was built with the idea of creating a community focused tool that could be used in real world scenarios.
